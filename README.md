# FSDigitRecognition
 
Hello, the project consists of client side (React.js) and server side (Python backend and pretrained model). The project is currently containerised with docker. I tried to develop 
both frontend and backend in a layered architecture. 


You can use the following command to initialise the entire project.

# Run project

```sh
 docker compose-up d
 
```

You can check backend endpoints and frontend web page from 

```sh

http://localhost:8000/docs  (Swagger UI)

http://localhost:3000	(Web Page)

```

You can test the project from both the back side and the front side by uploading the msint handwritten digits in the test_input folder. Although I have not yet completed the various edge cases, I have completed the general aspect of the project. 

Kind Regards, 
Hasanalp
